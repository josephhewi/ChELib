# ChELib
Repository of useful or important chemical engineering tools.

This is a very broken set of tools developed for use in my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering.  

contents:
 - CheLib.py: contains compound class.  This class is designed to provide query and calculation methods for the state of the compound.
 - EOS.py: contains the equation of state methods that are found in the compound class.
 - GUI.py: initial attempts at some sort of user interface.  Will most likely abandon for a web-based interface.
 - Reactions.py: Empty.  Schedule was too full to work on this at the time.
 
  Resources: These two databases need to be revisited. The current goal is to generate SQL databases with this information to optimize searches.
    - Antoine-Coeff: contains the antoine coeffecients for several hundred compounds.  
    - crit_info: critical information (acentric factor, critical pressure, etc.) for just a few dozen compounds.
